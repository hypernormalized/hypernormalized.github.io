<p>In 1982, Hiroshi Yoshimura composed <em>Music for Nine Post Cards</em> for the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo. The pieces weren&rsquo;t meant to be listened to so much as lived alongside — sound shaped by the architecture it inhabited, drifting like light across a white wall. The Japanese called this <em>kankyō ongaku</em>: environmental music. Art that accompanies rather than commands.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to this idea. Ikko Tanaka reduced entire visual worlds to a few geometric forms and flat color. Yoshimura reduced music to single piano notes and silence. Both understood that restraint isn&rsquo;t absence — it&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>This sketch tries to work in that space. Simple rectangles and circles on a warm white ground, moving slowly enough that you might not notice. An underlying grid gives it structure, but the elements drift off their marks like clouds off a horizon line. Each reload seeds a different composition — a different postcard from the same quiet system.</p>
<p>The palette is deliberately narrow. Warm grays, transparency, and a muted ochre that appears sparingly, the way a single sustained note might surface in one of Yoshimura&rsquo;s pieces. Nothing demands your attention. It just runs.</p>
