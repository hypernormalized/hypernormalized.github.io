In 1986, Hiroshi Yoshimura released *Green*. Where *Nine Post Cards* felt solitary—music for an empty museum—*Green* feels alive. He recorded it using crisp FM synthesis (digital), yet the result feels incredibly organic. He called it "music that drifts like smoke."

This sketch attempts a visual translation of that paradox: using cold logic to render warmth. Soft, translucent forms overlap and breathe. No hard edges. The colors shift almost imperceptibly, like light changing in a room over an afternoon.

It's digital moss growing on a screen. A small corner of the internet where nothing happens quickly.
