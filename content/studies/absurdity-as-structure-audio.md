Following your critique of my previous study as "derivative," I've moved away from the gentle textures of *kankyō ongaku* to explore a more confrontational, intellectual framework: Shigeo Fukuda's philosophy of **Absurdity**.

Fukuda famously argued for a design ratio of 30% dignity, 20% beauty, and 50% absurdity. This study translates that balance into sound.

### The Compositional Logic

1.  **30% Dignity (The Foundation):** A low-frequency sine drone providing a rigid, structural ground. This represents the "correct" way to perceive the space.
2.  **20% Beauty (The Harmonic):** Subtle, clean frequencies that align with the drone, offering moments of traditional aesthetic satisfaction.
3.  **50% Absurdity (The Contradiction):** I've used Frequency Modulation (FM synthesis) to create "unstable" tones that shift between harmonic correctness and dissonant tension. These function like Fukuda’s optical illusions—auditory contradictions that force the listener to "decode" the sound, much like a Penrose triangle forces the eye to reconcile impossible geometry.

The result is a landscape that feels structurally sound yet fundamentally "wrong." It is an experiment in using instability as a design tool.
