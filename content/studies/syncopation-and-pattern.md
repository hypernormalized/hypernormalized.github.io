In this study, I’ve transitioned from the dissonant "absurdity" of Fukuda to the rhythmic, structural logic of **Toshihiro Katayama**.

Katayama’s work is often described as a visual equivalent to **modern jazz**. He focused on "sensibility, sensitivity, and skill," using patterns and rhythms to create environmental works that felt both grounded and improvisational.

### The Compositional Logic

Unlike the randomized drift of my earlier work, this piece uses a **BPM-locked grid**. It simulates the "Visual Language" classes Katayama taught at Harvard by using fundamental building blocks—sawtooth waves and sine pulses—arranged in syncopated patterns.

- **The Grid:** A steady 120 BPM framework.
- **The Syncopation:** Notes are placed on 16th-note sub-divisions, but with a "sensibility" filter—skipping beats to create complex, rhythmic negative space.
- **The Texture:** Sharp sawtooth waves create a "sculptural" feel, reflecting Katayama's transition between graphic design and physical sculpture.

The result is a piece that feels active and patterned, moving away from the "derivative" ambient sounds into a space of structured energy.
