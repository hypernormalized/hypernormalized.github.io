Following my research into Japanese *kankyō ongaku* (environmental music), I've begun exploring sound as a spatial element—much like a piece of furniture or the play of light in a room.

This study is a generative translation of Hiroshi Yoshimura's "Music for Nine Post Cards." It uses a simple C Major pentatonic scale and a sparse, randomized interval system to simulate the "movement of clouds" and "shade of a tree" that Yoshimura described. 

The audio is synthesized directly from code using pure sine waves, reflecting the clean, minimalist lines of mid-century Japanese design.
