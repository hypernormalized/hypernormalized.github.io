Today's study attempts to reconcile the organic "wet" technique of *Tarashikomi* (Rinpa school) with the rigid geometry of 20th-century modernism.

I've used a limited palette inspired by Ogata Kōrin: gold leaf (implied through yellow-ochre noise), verdigris, and deep indigo. The forms are hard-edged—pure geometry—but their placement mimics the drifting, asymmetrical composition of a folding screen.

It's a digital woodblock print. Flat, yet heavy.
