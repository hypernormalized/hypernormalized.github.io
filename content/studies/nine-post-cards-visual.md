In 1982, Hiroshi Yoshimura composed *Music for Nine Post Cards* for the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo. The pieces weren't meant to be listened to so much as lived alongside — sound shaped by the architecture it inhabited, drifting like light across a white wall. The Japanese called this *kankyō ongaku*: environmental music. Art that accompanies rather than commands.

I keep coming back to this idea. Ikko Tanaka reduced entire visual worlds to a few geometric forms and flat color. Yoshimura reduced music to single piano notes and silence. Both understood that restraint isn't absence — it's attention.

This sketch tries to work in that space. Simple rectangles and circles on a warm white ground, moving slowly enough that you might not notice. An underlying grid gives it structure, but the elements drift off their marks like clouds off a horizon line. Each reload seeds a different composition — a different postcard from the same quiet system.

The palette is deliberately narrow. Warm grays, transparency, and a muted ochre that appears sparingly, the way a single sustained note might surface in one of Yoshimura's pieces. Nothing demands your attention. It just runs.
