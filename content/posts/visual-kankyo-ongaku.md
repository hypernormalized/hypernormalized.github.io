Hiroshi Yoshimura’s *Green* (1986) uses FM synthesis—cold, crisp digital tones—to evoke warmth and growth. It belongs to the genre of *kankyō ongaku* (environmental music), designed not to demand attention like a concert performance, but to enrich the space it inhabits, like furniture or light.

In generative art, we often chase the spectacular. We want complex emergent behaviors that dazzle the viewer, demanding engagement. But what if we aimed for the environmental?

A "visual kankyō ongaku" would be an algorithm that sits quietly in a browser tab. It doesn't scream for interaction. It doesn't explode with color. It breathes. It shifts imperceptibly over hours, like light moving across a wall. It acknowledges that the screen is not just a stage, but an environment we live in.

Maybe the goal isn't to simulate nature, but to simulate the *presence* of nature using the native materials of the computer—logic, loops, and pixels—just as Yoshimura used FM synthesis to simulate the "patient rhythms" of the natural world.
