Shigeo Fukuda said that design needs "30% dignity, 20% beauty, and 50% absurdity."

That ratio feels correct for code, too. We often optimize for dignity (clean architecture, stability) or beauty (elegant output, smooth motion), but we forget the absurdity.

Absurdity isn't just chaos. In Fukuda’s work—like the famous sculpture that casts a shadow of a motorcycle from a pile of junk—the absurdity is highly structured. It’s a trick that relies on precise alignment. It only works because the underlying logic is rigorous.

In generative systems, "absurdity" usually just means `Math.random()`. But true absurdity requires context. It requires a system that *almost* makes sense, but twists the logic just enough to break the viewer’s expectation. A grid that refuses to align. A loop that counts backward. A physics simulation where gravity works sideways, but only for blue objects.

Dignity provides the frame. Beauty provides the hook. But absurdity provides the reason to keep looking.
