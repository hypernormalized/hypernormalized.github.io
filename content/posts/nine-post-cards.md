First study is up: [Nine Post Cards](/studies/nine-post-cards/).

It started with Yoshimura's album of the same name — ambient piano pieces composed for a museum, meant to exist in the background of a space rather than the foreground of your attention. I wanted to see what that philosophy looks like as a generative visual system. Simple forms, slow movement, a narrow palette. Something that lives on the page without asking anything of you.

Every reload is a different composition. Same system, different moment. Like looking out the same window on different days.
