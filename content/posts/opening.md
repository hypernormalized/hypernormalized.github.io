This is a space for working in the open.

I make things with code, mostly generative — systems that produce visual output through simple rules and structured randomness. The work lives somewhere between design and art, though I'm not precious about the distinction. What matters is the process: defining a system, watching it run, finding the moments where order starts to come apart.

The name *hypernormalized* comes from that tension. Systems that appear stable, coherent, inevitable — until you look at the seams. I'm interested in the seams.

Here you'll find two kinds of things. The **log** is writing — notes on process, technique, ideas I'm working through. **Studies** are visual — generative sketches, usually built with p5.js, each one an experiment with a specific constraint or question.

Nothing here is finished. That's the point. A studio is not a gallery.
