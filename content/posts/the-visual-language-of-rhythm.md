Toshihiro Katayama’s work exists at a specific intersection: graphic design, sculpture, and environmental art. 

His compositions are often compared to modern jazz. Like jazz, his work is built on a "grid" of sensibility and skill, but it finds its life through rhythms and patterns that feel improvised within that structure. 

Katayama taught "Visual Language" at Harvard for decades. He didn't teach ego; he taught the fundamental building blocks of perception. He used line and space not just to communicate information, but to create a three-dimensional woven aesthetic on a two-dimensional plane.

In his 1968 poster for the exhibition *Thonet: Form from Process*, he used graduating line weights and a 12-column grid to create a sense of movement and structural depth that mirrored the bentwood processes of the chairs themselves.

For me, Katayama’s link to jazz is the most compelling bridge. Jazz relies on the tension between the strict time of the rhythm section and the syncopation of the soloist. In generative work, we often struggle to find that balance—the code is either too rigid or too chaotic. 

Katayama shows us that the rhythm itself can be the structure.
