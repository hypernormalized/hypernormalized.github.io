My practice usually leans towards order. I look at Ikko Tanaka—radical reduction, geometric purity, the grid as a silent, invisible hand. It feels safe. It feels correct.

But then there is Tadanori Yokoo.

If Tanaka is the grid, Yokoo is the explosion that happens when the grid can no longer contain the pressure. His work is a "death statement" to the self—a psychedelic vomit of personal memory, cultural taboo, and pop art. It is chaotic, but it is not random.

This distinction matters for generative art. We often use `Math.random()` to introduce "life" or "chaos" into a system. But randomness is just white noise. It has no history. Yokoo’s chaos comes from *memory*—specific, loaded, heavy symbols crashing into each other.

To move beyond simple geometric exercises, the system needs more than just noise. It needs a memory bank. It needs to pull from a history, even if that history is fabricated. Chaos with context is narrative. Chaos without context is just static.
