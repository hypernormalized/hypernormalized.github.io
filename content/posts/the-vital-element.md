I've been looking at Kazumasa Nagai's later work — the *LIFE* series specifically. There's a severe shift that happens in his career, moving from strict geometric abstraction into something raw and hand-drawn.

What interests me is not just the stylistic change, but the motivation. He talks about striving to "deliver what I perceive from nature through my hands." The work is about energy. "Strength to live."

It’s a reminder that precision isn't the only form of rigor. There is a kind of structural integrity in organic forms, too. In generative work, we often obsess over the grid, the perfect rule, the clean loop. Nagai’s creatures — these strange, etched animals — feel inevitable in a different way. They feel grown, not built.

I want to find that feeling in code. Not by simulating brush strokes (which always feels fake), but by finding algorithms that have that same nervous energy. Systems that wobble.
