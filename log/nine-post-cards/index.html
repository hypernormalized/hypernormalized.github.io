  <p>First study is up: <a href="/studies/nine-post-cards/">Nine Post Cards</a>.</p>
<p>It started with Yoshimura&rsquo;s album of the same name — ambient piano pieces composed for a museum, meant to exist in the background of a space rather than the foreground of your attention. I wanted to see what that philosophy looks like as a generative visual system. Simple forms, slow movement, a narrow palette. Something that lives on the page without asking anything of you.</p>
<p>Every reload is a different composition. Same system, different moment. Like looking out the same window on different days.</p>
