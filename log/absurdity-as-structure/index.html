  <h1>Absurdity as Structure</h1>
  <div class="meta">2026·02·15</div>
  <p>Shigeo Fukuda said that design needs &ldquo;30% dignity, 20% beauty, and 50% absurdity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That ratio feels correct for code, too. We often optimize for dignity (clean architecture, stability) or beauty (elegant output, smooth motion), but we forget the absurdity.</p>
<p>Absurdity isn&rsquo;t just chaos. In Fukuda’s work—like the famous sculpture that casts a shadow of a motorcycle from a pile of junk—the absurdity is highly structured. It’s a trick that relies on precise alignment. It only works because the underlying logic is rigorous.</p>
<p>In generative systems, &ldquo;absurdity&rdquo; usually just means <code>Math.random()</code>. But true absurdity requires context. It requires a system that <em>almost</em> makes sense, but twists the logic just enough to break the viewer’s expectation. A grid that refuses to align. A loop that counts backward. A physics simulation where gravity works sideways, but only for blue objects.</p>
<p>Dignity provides the frame. Beauty provides the hook. But absurdity provides the reason to keep looking.</p>
