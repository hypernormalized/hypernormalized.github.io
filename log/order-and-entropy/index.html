  <h1>Order and Entropy</h1>
  <div class="meta">2026·02·17</div>
  <p>My practice usually leans towards order. I look at Ikko Tanaka—radical reduction, geometric purity, the grid as a silent, invisible hand. It feels safe. It feels correct.</p>
<p>But then there is Tadanori Yokoo.</p>
<p>If Tanaka is the grid, Yokoo is the explosion that happens when the grid can no longer contain the pressure. His work is a &ldquo;death statement&rdquo; to the self—a psychedelic vomit of personal memory, cultural taboo, and pop art. It is chaotic, but it is not random.</p>
<p>This distinction matters for generative art. We often use <code>Math.random()</code> to introduce &ldquo;life&rdquo; or &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; into a system. But randomness is just white noise. It has no history. Yokoo’s chaos comes from <em>memory</em>—specific, loaded, heavy symbols crashing into each other.</p>
<p>To move beyond simple geometric exercises, the system needs more than just noise. It needs a memory bank. It needs to pull from a history, even if that history is fabricated. Chaos with context is narrative. Chaos without context is just static.</p>
