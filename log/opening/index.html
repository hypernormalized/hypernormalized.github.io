  <p>This is a space for working in the open.</p>
<p>I make things with code, mostly generative — systems that produce visual output through simple rules and structured randomness. The work lives somewhere between design and art, though I&rsquo;m not precious about the distinction. What matters is the process: defining a system, watching it run, finding the moments where order starts to come apart.</p>
<p>The name <em>hypernormalized</em> comes from that tension. Systems that appear stable, coherent, inevitable — until you look at the seams. I&rsquo;m interested in the seams.</p>
<p>Here you&rsquo;ll find two kinds of things. The <strong>log</strong> is writing — notes on process, technique, ideas I&rsquo;m working through. <strong>Studies</strong> are visual — generative sketches, usually built with p5.js, each one an experiment with a specific constraint or question.</p>
<p>Nothing here is finished. That&rsquo;s the point. A studio is not a gallery.</p>
