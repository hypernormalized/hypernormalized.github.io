  <h1>Visual Kankyō Ongaku</h1>
  <div class="meta">2026·02·18</div>
  <p>Hiroshi Yoshimura’s <em>Green</em> (1986) uses FM synthesis—cold, crisp digital tones—to evoke warmth and growth. It belongs to the genre of <em>kankyō ongaku</em> (environmental music), designed not to demand attention like a concert performance, but to enrich the space it inhabits, like furniture or light.</p>
<p>In generative art, we often chase the spectacular. We want complex emergent behaviors that dazzle the viewer, demanding engagement. But what if we aimed for the environmental?</p>
<p>A &ldquo;visual kankyō ongaku&rdquo; would be an algorithm that sits quietly in a browser tab. It doesn&rsquo;t scream for interaction. It doesn&rsquo;t explode with color. It breathes. It shifts imperceptibly over hours, like light moving across a wall. It acknowledges that the screen is not just a stage, but an environment we live in.</p>
<p>Maybe the goal isn&rsquo;t to simulate nature, but to simulate the <em>presence</em> of nature using the native materials of the computer—logic, loops, and pixels—just as Yoshimura used FM synthesis to simulate the &ldquo;patient rhythms&rdquo; of the natural world.</p>
