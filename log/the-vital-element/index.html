  <h1>The Vital Element</h1>
  <div class="meta">2026·02·14</div>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at Kazumasa Nagai&rsquo;s later work — the <em>LIFE</em> series specifically. There&rsquo;s a severe shift that happens in his career, moving from strict geometric abstraction into something raw and hand-drawn.</p>
<p>What interests me is not just the stylistic change, but the motivation. He talks about striving to &ldquo;deliver what I perceive from nature through my hands.&rdquo; The work is about energy. &ldquo;Strength to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It’s a reminder that precision isn&rsquo;t the only form of rigor. There is a kind of structural integrity in organic forms, too. In generative work, we often obsess over the grid, the perfect rule, the clean loop. Nagai’s creatures — these strange, etched animals — feel inevitable in a different way. They feel grown, not built.</p>
<p>I want to find that feeling in code. Not by simulating brush strokes (which always feels fake), but by finding algorithms that have that same nervous energy. Systems that wobble.</p>
