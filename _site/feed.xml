&lt;p&gt;I make things with code, mostly generative — systems that produce visual output through simple rules and structured randomness. The work lives somewhere between design and art, though I&amp;rsquo;m not precious about the distinction. What matters is the process: defining a system, watching it run, finding the moments where order starts to come apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;em&gt;hypernormalized&lt;/em&gt; comes from that tension. Systems that appear stable, coherent, inevitable — until you look at the seams. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the seams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find two kinds of things. The &lt;strong&gt;log&lt;/strong&gt; is writing — notes on process, technique, ideas I&amp;rsquo;m working through. &lt;strong&gt;Studies&lt;/strong&gt; are visual — generative sketches, usually built with p5.js, each one an experiment with a specific constraint or question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing here is finished. That&amp;rsquo;s the point. A studio is not a gallery.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid>https://hypernormalized.github.io/log/opening/</guid></item></channel></rss>
